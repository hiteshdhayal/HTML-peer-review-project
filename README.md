  README: 80s Retro Portfolio – Hitesh Dhayal

This project is a visually striking, **80s Synthwave-themed** personal portfolio. It transforms a standard professional resume into a radical, neon-drenched digital experience using only semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3 (no external frameworks required!).

---

### 🚀 Features

- **Retro Aesthetics:** Features a glowing "neon grid" background and vibrant cyan/magenta color palette.

- **CRT Monitor Effect:** Includes a subtle flicker animation to mimic the feel of an old-school vacuum tube monitor.

- **Responsive Design:** Max-width containers ensure the portfolio looks "tubular" on both desktop and mobile screens.

- **Semantic Structure:** Uses clean HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<table>`) for better SEO and accessibility.

- **Themed Typography:** Utilizes monospace fonts and text-shadowing to recreate the 1980s computer terminal look.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack

  - `linear-gradient` for the background grid.
